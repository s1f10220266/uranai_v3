-Architect
    INTJ Personality
    Architects are imaginative and strategic thinkers, with a plan for everything.
    Introduction
    Who is the Architect personality type?

    INTJ (Architect) is a personality type with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging traits. These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one.

    Thought constitutes the greatness of man. Man is a reed, the feeblest thing in nature, but he is a thinking reed.

    Blaise Pascal
    People with the INTJ personality type (Architects) are intellectually curious individuals with a deep-seated thirst for knowledge. INTJs tend to value creative ingenuity, straightforward rationality, and self-improvement. They consistently work toward enhancing intellectual abilities and are often driven by an intense desire to master any and every topic that piques their interest.

    A scene representing the INTJ (Architect) personality type. A female INTJ is seated on a chair, resting contemplatively on its armrest. She gazes at a large screen featuring an image of a male individual, surrounded by numerous checkboxes, flowcharts, and annotations. On a small table beside her, there is a glass of wine and a stack of books. A bat perches atop the screen, while two mice frolic on the floor. Torches in the background provide lighting for the scene.
    Logical and quick-witted, INTJs pride themselves on their ability to think for themselves, not to mention their uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy. Because their minds are never at rest, these personalities may sometimes struggle to find people who can keep up with their nonstop analysis of everything around them. But when they do find like-minded individuals who appreciate their intensity and depth of thought, INTJs form profound and intellectually stimulating relationships that they deeply treasure.

    A Pioneering Spirit
    INTJs question most things, basing their beliefs on solid evidence, reasoning, and rationality. Many personality types trust the status quo, relying on conventional wisdom and other people’s expertise to guide their lives. But ever-skeptical INTJ personalities prefer to make their own discoveries. In their quest to find better ways of doing things, they aren’t afraid to break the rules or risk disapproval – in fact, they often rather enjoy it.

    But as anyone with this personality type would tell you, a new idea isn’t worth anything unless it actually works. INTJs want to be successful, not just inventive. They bring a single-minded drive to their work, applying the full force of their insight, logic, and willpower. They have little patience for anyone who tries to slow them down by enforcing pointless rules or offering poorly thought-out criticism – though astute observations are generally welcome.

    People with the INTJ personality type, independent to the core, want to shake off other people’s expectations and pursue their own ideas.
    This personality type comes with a strong independent streak. INTJs don’t mind acting alone – in fact, they prefer their own company most of the time – perhaps in part because they don’t like waiting around for others to catch up with them. People with this personality type often have no problem making decisions without asking for anyone else’s input. At times, this lone-wolf behavior can come across as insensitive, as it fails to take into consideration others’ thoughts, desires, and plans.

    It would be a mistake, however, to view INTJ personalities as uncaring. Whatever the stereotypes about their stoic intellect, they feel deeply. When things go wrong or when they hurt others, they are personally affected and spend much time and energy trying to figure out why things happened the way that they did. These personalities may not always value emotion as a decision-making tool, and they have a very hard time relating to people who lead with their hearts, but they are still authentically human.

    A Thirst for Knowledge
    INTJs can be both the boldest of dreamers and the bitterest of pessimists. They believe that, through willpower and intelligence, they can achieve even the most challenging goals. They are firm believers that taking the easy way out in any given situation prevents people from achieving greatness. But these personalities may be cynical about human nature more generally, assuming that most people are lazy, unimaginative, or simply doomed to mediocrity.

    People with the INTJ personality type derive much of their self-esteem from their knowledge and mental acuity. In school, they may have been called “bookworms” or “nerds.” But rather than taking these labels as insults, many people with this type embrace them. They recognize their own ability to teach themselves about – and master – any topic that interests them, whether that’s coding or capoeira or classical music.

    INTJs don’t just learn new things for show – they genuinely enjoy expanding the limits of their knowledge.
    In their seemingly constant pursuit of knowledge, people with this personality type can sometimes be single-minded, with little patience for frivolity, distractions, or idle gossip. That said, they’re far from dull or humorless. Many INTJ personalities are known for their irreverent wit, and beneath their serious exteriors, they often have a sharp, delightfully sarcastic sense of humor.

    Social Frustrations
    INTJs aren’t known for being warm and fuzzy. They tend to prioritize rationality and success over politeness and pleasantries – in other words, they’d rather be right than popular. And because these personalities value truth and depth, many common social practices – from small talk to white lies – may seem pointless or downright stupid to them. As a result, they may inadvertently come across as rude or even offensive when they’re only trying to be honest.

    At times, people with the INTJ personality type may wonder whether dealing with other people is even worth the frustration.
    But like any personality type, INTJs do crave social interaction – they’d just prefer to surround themselves with people who share their values and priorities. Often, they can achieve this just by being themselves. When they pursue their interests, their authenticity can draw people to them – professionally, socially, and even romantically.

    The Chess Game of Life
    People with the INTJ personality type are full of contradictions. They are imaginative yet decisive, ambitious yet private, and curious yet focused. From the outside, these contradictions may seem baffling, but they make perfect sense once you understand the inner workings of this personality type’s mind.

    For these personalities, life is like a giant game of chess. Relying on strategy rather than chance, INTJs contemplate the strengths and weaknesses of each move before they make it. And they never lose faith that, with enough ingenuity and insight, they can find a way to win – no matter what challenges might arise along the way.

    -INTJ Strengths
        A scene representing INTJ (Architect) strengths. A male INTJ sits at a desk, papers strewn about, indicative of intense focus and strategic planning. His gaze is fixed on a wall adorned with a world map and geometric shapes interconnected by lines, suggesting a global perspective. To the left, a framed photograph of the man personalizes the workspace. To the right, a holder contains rolled-up documents, hinting at ongoing projects or conceptual ideas. On the floor, assorted military vehicle models and soldier figurines are spread out, possibly reflecting strategic interests or historical hobbies.
        Rational – People with the INTJ personality type (Architects) pride themselves on the power of their mind. They can reframe nearly any challenge as an opportunity to hone their rational thinking skills and expand their knowledge – and with this mindset, they can devise inventive solutions to even the most arduous of problems.
        Informed – Few personality types are as devoted as INTJs to developing rational, correct, and evidence-based opinions. Rather than hunches or half-baked assumptions, they base their conclusions on research and analysis. This gives them the conviction that they need to stand up for their ideas, even in the face of disagreement.
        Independent – For people with this personality type, conformity is more or less synonymous with mediocrity. Creative and self-motivated, INTJs strive to do things their own way. They can imagine few things more frustrating than allowing arbitrary rules or conventions to stand in the way of their success. Moreover, they are happy to make decisions without outside input or opinions. These individuals prefer to take matters into their own hands.
        Determined – This personality type is known for being ambitious and goal-oriented. INTJs won’t rest until they’ve achieved their own definition of success – which usually entails mastering the subjects and pursuits that matter to them. They are not known for taking the easy way out. They feel that the only way to achieve greatness is to face challenges head on.
        Curious – INTJs are open to new ideas – as long as those ideas are rational and evidence based, that is. Skeptical by nature, people with this personality type are especially drawn to offbeat or contrarian points of view. And if the facts prove them wrong, these types are generally happy to revise their opinions.
        Original – Without INTJs, the world would be a far less interesting place. This personality type’s rebellious streak is responsible for some of history’s most unconventional ideas and inventions. Even in their everyday lives, these personalities force the people around them to consider new (and sometimes surprising) ways of looking at things.
    -INTJ Weaknesses
        A scene representing INTJ (Architect) weaknesses. In a park setting, a male figure is animatedly discussing 'Moby Dick,' his enthusiasm evident from a thought bubble that contains an image of a whale. Standing opposite him, a female INTJ listens intently, a book in hand. Above her, a thought bubble with a miniature version of the man reveals her deep analysis or possible overthinking of the social exchange.
        Arrogant – INTJs might be knowledgeable, but they’re not infallible. Their self-assurance can blind them to useful input from other people – especially anyone they deem to be intellectually inferior. These personalities can also come across as needlessly harsh or single-minded in trying to prove others wrong.
        Dismissive of Emotions – For this type, rationality is king. But emotional context often matters more than people with this personality type care to admit. INTJs can get impatient with anyone who seems to value feelings more than facts. Unfortunately, ignoring emotion is its own type of bias – one that can cloud this personality type’s judgment.
        Overly Critical – These personalities tend to have a great deal of self-control, particularly when it comes to thoughts and feelings. When the people in their lives fail to match their level of restraint, INTJs can appear scathingly critical. But this criticism can be unfair – based on arbitrary standards rather than a full understanding of human nature.
        Combative – People with this personality type hate blindly following anything without understanding why. This includes restrictions and the authority figures who impose them. INTJs can get caught up in arguing about useless rules and regulations – but sometimes these battles are distractions from more important matters.
        Socially Clueless – INTJs’ relentless rationality can lead to frustration in their social lives. Their efforts to defy expectations may leave them feeling isolated or disconnected from other people. At times, these personalities may become cynical about the value of relationships altogether, questioning the importance of love and connection.

-Logician
    INTP Personality
    Logicians are innovative inventors with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge.
    Introduction
    Who is the Logician personality type?

    INTP (Logician) is a personality type with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting traits. These flexible thinkers enjoy taking an unconventional approach to many aspects of life. They often seek out unlikely paths, mixing willingness to experiment with personal creativity.

    The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence.

    ALBERT EINSTEIN
    People with the INTP personality type (Logicians) pride themselves on their unique perspective and vigorous intellect. They can’t help but puzzle over the mysteries of the universe – which may explain why some of the most influential philosophers and scientists of all time have been INTPs. People with this personality type tend to prefer solitude, as they can easily become immersed in their thoughts when they are left to their own devices. They are also incredibly creative and inventive, and they are not afraid to express their novel ways of thinking or to stand out from the crowd.

    The Life of the Mind
    INTP personalities often lose themselves in thought – which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. People with this personality type hardly ever stop thinking. From the moment they wake up, their mind buzzes with ideas, questions, and insights. At times, they may even find themselves conducting full-fledged debates in their own heads. And it’s not uncommon for them to drift off during conversations. Their mind simply executes a detour to uncharted territories of thought where new ideas are constantly being born.

    Imaginative and curious, people with the INTP personality type can find endless fascination in the workings of their own mind.
    From the outside, INTPs may seem to live in a never-ending daydream. They have a reputation for being pensive, detached, and a bit reserved. That is, until they actively try to direct all of their mental energy on the moment or the person at hand. But regardless of which mode they’re in, INTPs are Introverts and tend to get tired out by extensive socializing. After a long day, they crave time alone to consult their own thoughts.

    INTPs cherish their independence and often find themselves most productive during the late evening hours when distractions are kept to a minimum. Even so, it would be a mistake to think that these personalities are unfriendly or uptight. When they connect with someone who can match their mental energy, INTPs absolutely light up, leaping from one thought to another. Few things energize them like the opportunity to swap ideas or enjoy a lively debate with another curious, inquiring soul.

    INTP (Logician) personality
    Elementary, My Dear Logician
    People with the INTP personality type love to analyze patterns. Without necessarily knowing how they do it, they often have a Sherlock Holmes-like knack for spotting discrepancies and irregularities. In other words, it might be a bad idea to lie to someone with this type.

    Ironically, they shouldn’t always be held at their word. INTPs rarely mean to be dishonest, but with their active mind, they sometimes overflow with ideas and theories that they haven’t thought through all the way. These personalities may change their mind on anything from their weekend plans to a fundamental moral principle without ever realizing that they’d appeared to have made up their mind in the first place. In addition, they are often happy to play devil’s advocate in order to keep an interesting discussion humming along.

    For people with the INTP personality type, the best conversations are like brainstorming sessions, with plenty of room for unconventional thoughts and off-the-wall what-ifs.
    INTPs could spend all day musing about ideas and possibilities – and they often do. That said, the practical, everyday work of turning those ideas into reality doesn’t always hold their interest. Fortunately, when it comes to dissecting a tricky, multilayered problem and coming up with a creative solution, few personality types can match INTPs’ creative genius and potential.

    Mysteries of the Universe
    People with this personality type want to understand everything in the universe, but one area in particular tends to mystify them: human nature. As their name suggests, INTPs (a.k.a Logicians) feel most at home in the realm of logic and rationality. As a result, they can find themselves baffled by the illogical, irrational ways that feelings and emotions influence people’s behavior – including their own.

    This doesn’t mean that INTPs are unfeeling. These personalities generally want to offer emotional support to their friends and loved ones, but they don’t necessarily know how. And because they can’t decide on the best, most efficient way to offer support, they may hold off on doing or saying anything at all.

    This “analysis paralysis” can affect multiple areas of INTPs’ lives. People with this personality type can overthink even the smallest of decisions. This sometimes makes them feel ineffective and stuck, so exhausted by the endless parade of thoughts in their mind that they struggle to get things done.

    The good news is that they don’t have to stay stuck for long. Their unique strengths include everything that they need to pull themselves out of the ruts that they occasionally fall into. By leveraging their creativity and their open-mindedness, people with the INTP personality type can reach their full potential – both as thinkers and as happy, well-rounded people.

    -INTP Strengths
        INTP (Logician) strengths
        Analytical – People with the INTP personality type (Logicians) analyze everything that they come across. This gives them a knack for spotting unexpected patterns and connections that other personalities might overlook.
        Original – Thanks to their unrelenting imagination, these personalities can come up with creative, counterintuitive ideas that wouldn’t occur to most people. Not all of these ideas are feasible, of course, but INTPs’ willingness to think outside the box can produce remarkable innovations.
        Open-Minded – INTPs are driven by curiosity and an intense desire to learn. As they learn, they’re rarely afraid to shift their perspective – even in matters of politics, religion, and philosophy. People with this personality type tend to be receptive to new ideas, as long as those ideas are something that they connect with on an intellectual level.
        Curious – These personalities are always casting about for new things to learn about. One week, they might be obsessed with geophysics, and the next, they might lose themselves in videos about guitar building. When inspiration strikes, INTPs go all in on their newfound interest, learning everything that they can.
        Honest – INTPs care about the truth. Rather than taking comfort in ideology or received ideas, they want to understand what’s really going on beneath the surface of things. As a result, they can be relied upon to combat bias and misinformation even when it isn’t easy to do so – and they expect other people to be honest with them in return.
    -INTP Weaknesses
        INTP (Logician) weaknesses
        Disconnected – INTP personalities can get lost in their own train of thought even when they’re with other people. After finally resurfacing with something to say, they may find that the conversation has moved on without them. This can cause people with this personality type to feel disconnected from others, especially in large social gatherings.
        Insensitive – INTPs see rationality as the key to a better, happier world. At times, they may underestimate the importance of such irrational values as emotion, compassion, etiquette, and tradition. As a result, these personalities may inadvertently come across as insensitive or unkind even though their intentions are generally good.
        Dissatisfied – People with this personality type can’t help but imagine how things could be better than they already are. INTPs are constantly on the lookout for problems to solve, topics to learn, and new ways to approach things. Taken too far, this mindset can become overwhelming, with these personalities constantly trying to reinvent the wheel rather than reliably addressing their needs and responsibilities.
        Overthinkers – INTPs’ minds are ceaselessly active, toiling away even when they’re not consciously thinking. While their rapid-fire thoughts can be beneficial at times, they can also cause them to overthink and fall prey to analysis paralysis. When this occurs, INTPs can struggle to reach a decision or take action because they’re too caught up in considering every possible outcome or angle.
        Impatient – INTP personalities take pride in their knowledge and in sharing their ideas. When it comes to explaining their rationale, however, they aren’t always patient. If their conversation partner doesn’t follow along or seem sufficiently interested, they may give up with a dismissive “never mind.”

-Commander
    ENTJ Personality
    Commanders are bold, imaginative, and strong-willed, always finding a way – or making one.
    Introduction
    Who is the Commander personality type?

    ENTJ (Commander) is a personality type with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging traits. They are decisive people who love momentum and accomplishment. They gather information to construct their creative visions but rarely hesitate for long before acting on them.

    Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.

    Steve Jobs
    People with the ENTJ personality type (Commanders) are natural-born leaders. Embodying the gifts of charisma and confidence, ENTJs project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, these personalities are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination, and sharp mind to achieve whatever objectives they’ve set for themselves. Their intensity might sometimes rub people the wrong way, but ultimately, ENTJs take pride in both their work ethic and their impressive level of self-discipline.

    ENTJ personalities perceive themselves to be a strong positive influence on others.
    Striving for Greatness
    If there’s anything that people with this personality type love, it’s a good challenge, big or small, and they firmly believe that, given enough time and resources, they can achieve any goal. This quality makes ENTJs brilliant entrepreneurs, and their ability to think strategically and hold a long-term focus while executing each step of their plans with determination and precision makes them powerful business leaders.

    ENTJ (Commander) personality
    This determination is often a self-fulfilling prophecy, as ENTJ personalities push their goals through with sheer willpower where others might give up and move on, and they are likely to push everyone else right along with them, achieving spectacular results in the process.

    At the negotiating table, be it in a corporate environment or buying a car, ENTJs are dominant, unforgiving, and unyielding. This isn’t because they are coldhearted or vicious per se – it’s more that these personalities genuinely enjoy the challenge, the battle of wits, and the repartee that comes from this environment. If the other side can’t keep up, that’s no reason for them to fold on their own core tenet of ultimate victory.

    The underlying thought running through an ENTJ’s mind might be something like “I don’t care if you call me an insensitive b*****d, as long as I remain an efficient b*****d.”
    ENTJs respect those who can match them intellectually and also display precision and quality in their actions, equal to their own. These personalities have a particular skill in recognizing the talents of others, and this helps in their team-building efforts (since no one, no matter how brilliant, can do everything alone). However, they also have a particular skill in calling out others’ failures with a chilling degree of insensitivity, and this is where they really start to run into trouble.

    A Worthy Challenge
    Emotional expression isn’t the strong suit of any Analyst (NT) type, but ENTJs’ distance from their emotions is especially public and felt directly by a much broader swath of people. Especially in a professional environment, these personalities may inadvertently overlook the emotional sensitivity of individuals who they perceive as inefficient or lazy. To people with this personality type, emotional displays are generally displays of weakness, and it’s easy to make enemies with this approach – ENTJs will do well to remember that they absolutely depend on having a functioning team, not just to achieve their goals but for their validation and feedback as well, something that they are, curiously, very sensitive to.

    ENTJ personalities are true powerhouses, and they cultivate an image of being larger than life – and often enough they are. They need to remember, though, that their stature comes not just from their own actions but from the actions of the team that props them up. It’s important for them to recognize the contributions, talents, and needs of their support network – especially from an emotional standpoint. Even if they have to adopt a “fake it ‘til you make it” mentality, if people with the ENTJ personality type are able to combine an emotionally healthy focus alongside their many strengths, they will be rewarded with deep, satisfying relationships and all the challenging victories that they can handle.

    -ENTJ Strengths
        ENTJ (Commander) strengths
        Efficient – People with the ENTJ personality type (Commanders) see inefficiency not just as a problem in its own right but as something that pulls time and energy away from all their future goals, an elaborate sabotage consisting of irrationality and laziness. They will root out such behavior wherever they go.
        Energetic – ENTJ personalities approach their responsibilities with vigor and drive. This is not a type to shy away from busy schedules or complex challenges. In fact, the more they are able to accomplish throughout the day, the more energized they feel, and they will happily share this infectious enthusiasm for productivity with the people around them.
        Self-Confident – ENTJs generally make their opinions known, trust in their abilities to get things done, and believe in their capacities as leaders. They are the most likely personality type to say they feel confident facing life’s day-to-day challenges.
        Strong-Willed – People with the ENTJ personality type don’t give up when the going gets tough. Instead, they relentlessly strive to achieve their goals. Nothing is quite as satisfying to them as accomplishing something that they’ve set their mind to.
        Strategic Thinkers – ENTJ personalities exemplify the difference between moment-to-moment crisis management and navigating the challenges and steps of a bigger plan. They are known for examining every angle of a problem and not just resolving momentary issues but moving the whole project forward with their solutions.
        Charismatic and Inspiring – All of the strengths listed above combine to create individuals who are able to inspire and invigorate others, and this in turn helps ENTJs to accomplish their most ambitious goals, which could never be finished alone.
    -ENTJ Weaknesses
        ENTJ (Commander) weaknesses
        Stubborn and Dominant – Sometimes all this confidence and willpower can go too far. ENTJ personalities are all too capable of digging in their heels, trying to win every single debate, and only pushing for their vision without considering the input of others.
        Intolerant – “It’s my way or the highway” – People with the ENTJ personality type are notoriously unsupportive of ideas that distract from their primary goals and even more so of ideas based on emotional considerations. They won’t hesitate to make that fact clear to those around them.
        Impatient – Some people need more time to think than others – an intolerable delay to quick-thinking ENTJ personalities. They may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or disinterest in their haste – a terrible mistake to make.
        Arrogant – ENTJs respect quick thoughts and firm convictions and may look down on those who don’t match up. This is a challenge for most other personality types, who are perhaps not timid in their own right but will seem so beside this sometimes overbearing type.
        Poor Handling of Emotions – At times, ENTJ personalities can be distant from their own emotional expression and sometimes downright scornful of others’. People with this personality type often trample others’ feelings, inadvertently hurting their partners and friends, especially in emotionally charged situations.
        Cold and Ruthless – Their obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism, especially professionally, make ENTJs fairly insensitive in pursuing their goals, dismissing personal circumstances, sensitivities, and preferences as irrational or irrelevant.

-Debater
    ENTP Personality
    Debaters are curious and flexible thinkers who cannot resist an intellectual challenge.
    Introduction
    Who is the Debater personality type?

    ENTP (Debater) is a personality type with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting traits. They tend to be bold and creative, deconstructing and rebuilding ideas with great mental agility. They pursue their goals vigorously despite any resistance they might encounter.

    Quick-witted and audacious, people with the ENTP personality type (Debaters) aren’t afraid to disagree with the status quo. In fact, they’re not afraid to disagree with pretty much anything or anyone. Few things light up these personalities more than a bit of verbal sparring – and if the conversation veers into controversial terrain, so much the better.

    It would be a mistake, though, to think of ENTPs as disagreeable or mean-spirited. Instead, people with this personality type are knowledgeable and curious with a playful sense of humor, and they can be incredibly entertaining. They simply have an offbeat, contrarian idea of fun – one that usually involves a healthy dose of spirited debate.

    ENTP personalities are the ultimate devil’s advocates, thriving on the process of shredding people’s arguments to pieces. Sometimes they even rebel against their own beliefs by arguing the opposing viewpoint – just to see how the world looks from the other side.
    ENTP (Debater) personality
    Breaking the Rules
    Follow the path of the unsafe, independent thinker. Expose your ideas to the dangers of controversy.

    Thomas J. Watson
    ENTPs are known for their rebellious streak. For this personality type, no belief is too sacred to be questioned, no idea is too fundamental to be scrutinized, and no rule is too important to be broken or at least thoroughly tested. This may make ENTP personalities seem overly cavalier or defiant, but at their core, their innate tendency to test boundaries has more to do with their desire for innovation and change.

    As they see it, most people are too ready to do as they’re told and blindly conform to social norms, pressures, and standards. ENTP personalities enjoy the mental exercise of questioning the prevailing mode of thought, and they take a certain pleasure in uncovering the value of underdogs and outliers. Their active mind can’t help but rethink the things that everyone else takes for granted and pushes them in clever new directions.

    For many people with the ENTP personality type, one of life’s greatest challenges is to translate their wide-ranging intellectual energy into real-world achievements and contributions.
    While ENTPs love to brainstorm and think big, these personalities tend to avoid getting caught doing the “grunt work” of implementing their ideas, and they sometimes have a hard time sticking to their goals. To some extent, this makes sense – they have far too many thoughts and suggestions to keep track of them all, let alone turn them into reality. But unless ENTPs develop the willingness to identify and actually follow through on their priorities, they may struggle to harness their full potential.

    The Cost of Contrarianism
    ENTPs’ capacity for debate is legendary, but that doesn’t mean that it’s always helpful. When they openly question their boss in a meeting or pick apart everything that their significant other says, these sharp personalities may think they’re being champions of rationality and logic. But they may also be doing their chances of success and happiness more harm than good.

    Not every occasion calls for this personality type’s default contrarianism, and most people can only stand to have their beliefs questioned and their feelings brushed aside for so long. As a result, ENTPs may find that their quarrelsome fun burns many bridges, often inadvertently. These personalities are respected for their vision, confidence, knowledge, and keen sense of humor – but unless they cultivate a bit of sensitivity, they may struggle to maintain deeper relationships or even to achieve their professional goals.

    Many ENTPs find that a more compassionate approach is worth exploring as they strive to build solid relationships.
    With time, many ENTP personalities realize that their ideal life involves other people and that spending too much energy on “winning” arguments ultimately means robbing themselves of the support that they need to get where they want to be in life. The good news is that people with this personality type will never lose their sharply nonconformist edge. They can simply use their cognitive flexibility to understand and explore others’ perspectives, recognizing the value of consideration and compromise alongside logic and progress.


    -ENTP Strengths
        ENTP (Debater) strengths
        Knowledgeable – People with the ENTP personality type (Debaters) rarely pass up a good opportunity to learn something new, especially abstract concepts. This information isn’t usually absorbed for any planned purpose as with dedicated studying – they just find it fascinating.
        Quick Thinkers – ENTP personalities have tremendously flexible minds and are able to shift from idea to idea with little effort, drawing on their accumulated knowledge to prove their points, or their opponents’, as they see fit. In fact, ENTPs are the most likely personality type to quickly jump from one topic to another when they are enthralled in a conversation, never missing a beat.
        Original – Having little attachment to tradition, ENTP personalities are able to discard existing systems and methods and pull together disparate ideas from their extensive knowledge base to formulate bold new ideas. If presented with chronic, systemic problems and given rein to solve them, they respond with unabashed glee.
        Excellent Brainstormers – Nothing is quite as enjoyable to people with the ENTP personality type as analyzing problems from every angle to find the best solutions. Combining their knowledge and originality to splay out every aspect of the subject at hand, rejecting without remorse options that don’t work, and presenting ever more possibilities, ENTPs are irreplaceable in brainstorming sessions.
        Charismatic – People with the ENTP personality type have a way with words and wit that others find intriguing. Their confidence, quick thought, and ability to connect seemingly separate ideas in novel ways create a style of communication that is charming, even entertaining, and informative at the same time.
        Energetic – When given a chance to combine these traits to examine an interesting problem, ENTP personalities can be truly impressive in their enthusiasm and energy, having no qualms with putting in long days and nights to find a solution.
    -ENTP Weaknesses
        ENTP (Debater) weaknesses
        Very Argumentative – If there’s anything ENTPs enjoy, it’s the mental exercise of debating an idea. More consensus-oriented personality types rarely appreciate the vigor with which these personalities tear down their beliefs and methods, sometimes leading to a great deal of tension.
        Insensitive – Being so rational, ENTPs often misjudge others’ feelings and push their debates well past others’ tolerance levels. People with this personality type don’t really consider emotional points to be valid in such debates either, which magnifies the issue tremendously.
        Intolerant – Unless people are able to back up their ideas in a round of mental sparring, ENTPs are likely to dismiss not just the ideas but the people themselves. Either a suggestion can stand up to rational scrutiny, or it’s not worth bothering with.
        Can Find It Difficult to Focus – The same flexibility that allows ENTP personalities to come up with such original plans and ideas makes them readapt perfectly good ones far too often or to even drop them entirely as the initial excitement wanes and newer thoughts come along. Boredom comes too easily for these active types, and fresh thoughts are the solution, though not always a helpful one.
        Dislike Practical Matters – ENTPs, with their preference for spontaneity and novelty, often struggle with organization, structure, and all things practical. People with this personality type are interested in what could be – malleable concepts like ideas and plans that can be adapted and debated. When it comes to hard details and day-to-day execution, these personalities tend to lose interest, often with the consequence of their plans never seeing the light of day.

-Advocate
    INFJ Personality
    Advocates are quiet visionaries, often serving as inspiring and tireless idealists.
    Introduction
    Who is the Advocate personality type?

    INFJ (Advocate) is a personality type with the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging traits. They tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. Their inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things.

    Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being.

    Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe
    Idealistic and principled, people with the INFJ personality type (Advocates) aren’t content to coast through life – they want to stand up and make a difference. For these compassionate personalities, success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force for good in the world.

    While they have lofty goals and ambitions, INFJs shouldn’t be mistaken for idle dreamers. People with this personality type care about integrity, and they’re rarely satisfied until they’ve done what they know to be right. Conscientious to the core, they move through life with a clear sense of their values, and they aim to never lose sight of what truly matters – not according to other people or society at large but according to their own wisdom and intuition.

    INFJ (Advocate) personality
    INFJ personalities might come across as somewhat reserved, but they are fueled by a profound internal passion. Stimulated by deep, reflective thought and an enormous amount of empathy, they dedicate themselves to the pursuit of purpose.
    Seeking Purpose
    Perhaps because their personality type is so uncommon, INFJs tend to carry around a sense – whether conscious or not – of being different from most people. With their rich inner lives and their deep, abiding desire to find their life purpose, they don’t always fit in with those around them. This isn’t to say that INFJ personalities can’t enjoy social acceptance or close relationships – only that they sometimes feel misunderstood or at odds with the world.

    Fortunately, this sense of being out of step doesn’t diminish INFJs’ commitment to making the world a better place. These personalities are troubled by injustice, and they typically care more about altruism than personal gain. They often feel called to use their strengths – including creativity, imagination, and sensitivity – to uplift others and spread compassion.

    Nothing lights up an INFJ personality like changing someone else’s life for the better.
    Many INFJs see helping others as their mission in life, and they’re always looking for ways to step in and speak up for what is right. People with this personality type also aspire to fix society’s deeper problems in the hopes that unfairness and hardship can become things of the past. At times, however, INFJs may focus so intently on their ideals that they don’t take adequate care of themselves – a pattern that can lead to stress and burnout.

    Connecting with Others (and Themselves)
    INFJs value deep, authentic relationships with others. Few things bring these personalities as much joy as truly knowing another person – and being known in return. INFJs enjoy meaningful conversations far more than small talk, and they tend to communicate in a way that is warm and sensitive. This emotional honesty and insight can make a powerful impression on the people around them.

    A few close relationships, provided that they’re genuine, can fill INFJs’ hearts to the brim.
    Thoughtful and often selfless, INFJ personalities pour a great deal of energy and care into their relationships, but this doesn’t mean that they always feel appreciated in return. People with this personality type tend to slow down and really evaluate how what they do might impact others before they take action. Consequently, it can frustrate them when other people don’t recognize their good intentions. INFJs are very sensitive to criticism of any kind and can take things very personally.

    A Personal Mission
    Many INFJ personalities feel that their life has a unique purpose – a mission that they were put onto this earth to fulfill. For them, one of the most rewarding aspects of life is seeking out this purpose – and then, once they’ve found it, striving to do it justice.

    When INFJs encounter inequity or unfairness, they rarely give up – instead, they consult their intuition and their compassion to find a solution. With their innate ability to balance the heart with the head, these dedicated types are hardwired to right the wrongs of the world, no matter how big or small. These personalities just need to remember that while they’re busy taking care of everyone else, they need to pause sometimes and take care of themselves as well.

    -INFJ Strengths
        INFJ (Advocate) strengths
        Insightful – People with the INFJ personality type (Advocates) know all too well that appearances can be misleading. These personalities strive to move beyond superficiality and seek out the deeper truths in life. This can give them an almost uncanny ability to understand people’s true motivations, feelings, and needs.
        Principled – INFJs tend to have strong beliefs and values, particularly when it comes to matters of ethics. They consider lying to be morally wrong, and they make a concerted effort to not deceive others – even when they could directly benefit from doing so. In fact, they are the least likely personality type to say they sometimes take advantage of other people.
        Passionate – INFJ personalities crave a sense of purpose in life. Rather than living on autopilot or sticking to the status quo, they want to chase after their dreams. This isn’t a personality type that shies away from shooting for the stars – they are energized and impassioned by the beauty of their visions for the future.
        Altruistic – People with this personality type aren’t happy to succeed at another person’s expense. INFJs want to use their strengths for the greater good, and they rarely lose sight of how their words and actions might affect others. In their heart of hearts, they want to make the world a better place, starting with the people around them.
        Creative – INFJ personalities aren’t exactly like everyone else – and that’s a wonderful thing. They embrace their creative side, always on the lookout for opportunities to express themselves and think outside the box.
    -INFJ Weaknesses
        INFJ (Advocate) weaknesses
        Sensitive to Criticism – INFJs are often averse to criticism, especially if they believe that someone is challenging their most cherished principles or values. When it comes to the issues that are near and dear to them, people with this personality type can become defensive, dismissive, or angry.
        Reluctant to Open Up – INFJ personalities value honesty and authenticity, but they’re also private. They may find it difficult to open up and be vulnerable about their struggles, not wanting to burden someone else with their issues. Unfortunately, when they don’t ask for help, they may inadvertently hold themselves back or create distance in their relationships.
        Perfectionistic – These visionary personalities are all but defined by idealism. While this is a wonderful quality in many ways, it doesn’t always leave room for the messiness of real life. INFJs might find it difficult to appreciate their jobs, living situations, or relationships if they’re continually fixating on imperfections and wondering whether they should be looking for something better.
        Avoiding the Ordinary – INFJs yearn to do extraordinary things with their lives. But it’s hard to achieve anything extraordinary without breaking it down into small, manageable steps. Unless they translate their dreams into everyday routines and to-do lists, they may struggle to turn their grand visions into reality.
        Prone to Burnout – INFJs’ perfectionism and reserve leave them with few options for letting off steam. People with this personality type can exhaust themselves if they don’t balance their drive to help others with necessary self-care and rest.

-Mediator
    INFP Personality
    Mediators are poetic, kind, and altruistic people, always eager to help a good cause.
    Introduction
    Who is the Mediator personality type?

    INFP (Mediator) is a personality type with the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting traits. These rare personality types tend to be quiet, open-minded, and imaginative, and they apply a caring and creative approach to everything they do.

    Although they may seem quiet or unassuming, people with the INFP personality type (Mediators) have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their mind. INFPs are known for their sensitivity – these personalities can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them. They are known to be extremely sentimental and nostalgic, often holding onto special keepsakes and memorabilia that brighten their days and fill their heart with joy.

    Idealistic and empathetic, people with the INFP personality type long for deep, soulful relationships, and they feel called to help others. Due to the fast-paced and competitive nature of our society, they may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that doesn’t seem to appreciate the traits that make them unique. Yet it is precisely because INFPs brim with such rich sensitivity and profound creativity that they possess the unique potential to connect deeply and initiate positive change.

    All that is gold does not glitter; not all those who wander are lost; the old that is strong does not wither; deep roots are not reached by the frost.

    J. R. R. TOLKIEN
    INFP (Mediator) personality
    The Gift of Empathy
    INFP personalities share a sincere curiosity about the depths of human nature. Introspective to the core, they’re exquisitely attuned to their own thoughts and feelings, but they yearn to understand the people around them as well. INFPs are compassionate and nonjudgmental, always willing to hear another person’s story. When someone opens up to them or turns to them for comfort, they feel honored to listen and be of help.

    Empathy is among the INFP personality type’s greatest gifts, but at times it can be a liability. The troubles of the world weigh heavily on their shoulders, and these personalities can be vulnerable to internalizing other people’s negative moods or mindsets. Unless they learn to set boundaries, INFPs may feel overwhelmed by just how many wrongs there are that need to be set right.

    Speaking Their Truth
    Few things make INFP personalities more uneasy than pretending to be someone they aren’t. With their sensitivity and their commitment to authenticity, people with this personality type tend to crave opportunities for creative self-expression. It comes as no surprise, then, that many famous INFPs are poets, writers, actors, and artists. They can’t help but muse about the meaning and purpose of life, dreaming up all sorts of stories, ideas, and possibilities along the way.

    INFPs have a talent for self-expression. They may reveal their innermost thoughts and secrets through metaphors and fictional characters.
    Through these imaginative landscapes, these soulful personalities can explore their own inner nature as well as their place in the world. While this is a beautiful trait, INFPs sometimes show a tendency to daydream and fantasize rather than take action. At times, these personalities may intensely deliberate with themselves in their heads, wrestling with their options until the last possible moment. To avoid feeling frustrated, unfulfilled, or incapable, INFPs need to make sure that they take decisive steps to turn their dreams and ideas into reality.

    In Search of a Calling
    People with this personality type tend to feel directionless or stuck until they connect with a sense of purpose for their life. For many, this purpose has something to do with uplifting others. And while they want to help anyone and everyone, INFP personalities need to focus their energy and efforts – otherwise, they can end up exhausted.

    Fortunately, like flowers in the spring, an INFP’s creativity and idealism can bloom even after the darkest of seasons. Although they know the world will never be perfect, they still care about making it better however they can. This quiet belief in doing the right thing may explain why INFP personalities so often inspire compassion, kindness, and beauty wherever they go.


    -INFP Strengths
        INFP (Mediator) strengths
        Empathetic – People with the INFP personality type (Mediators) don’t just care about those around them in an abstract sense – they can actually feel another person’s emotions, from joy and elation to sorrow and regret. Because of their sensitivity, these personalities tend to be thoughtful and kindhearted, and they hate the idea of hurting anyone, even unintentionally.
        Generous – INFPs rarely enjoy succeeding at others’ expense. They feel called to share the good things in their lives, give credit where it’s due, and uplift the people around them. These personalities want to contribute to a world where every voice is heard and no one’s needs go unmet.
        Open-Minded – Tolerant and accepting, INFPs try not to judge anyone else’s beliefs, lifestyles, or decisions. This is a personality type that prefers compassion to faultfinding. Many feel empathy even for those who have done wrong. Because they’re so accepting, INFPs often become confidants for their friends and loved ones – and occasionally for total strangers.
        Creative – INFP personalities love to see things from unconventional perspectives. Few things give them more pleasure than allowing their mind to wander through all sorts of ideas and possibilities and daydreams. It’s no wonder, then, that many INFPs are drawn to creative pursuits – or that this personality type is well represented among writers and artists.
        Passionate – INFPs contain a deep well of passion, primarily driven by their profound empathy, strong internal values, and ceaseless curiosity about the human experience. When an idea or movement captures their imagination, these individuals want to give their whole heart to it. People with the INFP personality type may not always be outspoken, but that doesn’t diminish their strong feelings for a cause that speaks to their beliefs and convictions.
        Idealistic – INFP personalities strive to follow their conscience even when doing the right thing isn’t easy or convenient. They rarely lose sight of their desire to live a meaningful, purpose-filled life – one that helps others and leaves the world a better place.
    -INFP Weaknesses
        INFP (Mediator) weaknesses
        Unrealistic – Nothing in this world is perfect – and that can be a difficult truth for INFPs to accept. People with this personality type can be hopeless romantics, with rose-colored visions of what their lives should be like. This can set them up for disappointment when reality inevitably falls short of their dreams.
        Self-Isolating – INFP personalities long to connect with others, but they don’t always know how. Especially in new environments, they may be reluctant to put themselves out there in ways that would help them make new friends or become involved in a new community. As a result, people with the INFP personality type may sometimes feel lonely or isolated.
        Unfocused – INFPs’ imaginative, introspective nature doesn’t always lend itself to productivity. Many people with this personality type get frustrated by how difficult they find it to buckle down and get things done. The problem isn’t that they are incapable – rather, it’s that INFPs run into problems when they become so caught up in different ideas and ideals that they fail to commit to a course of action.
        Emotionally Vulnerable – The emotional attunement of these personalities is among their greatest strengths. But unless they establish boundaries, they can be at risk of absorbing other people’s negative moods or attitudes. And this can be detrimental to their personal peace and productivity, as INFPs are the most likely personality type to say negative emotions get in the way of their ability to think clearly.
        Too Eager to Please – Conflict tends to be stressful for INFPs, who yearn for harmony and acceptance. When someone dislikes or disapproves of them, these personalities may become fixated on trying to clear the air and change that person’s mind. They might even take responsibility and apologize for things that are not their fault at all in an effort to make sure that they are in everyone’s good graces. Unfortunately, INFPs’ desire to please others can drain their energy, eclipsing their inner wisdom and their awareness of their own needs.
        Self-Critical – INFPs believe in their unique potential, and they desperately want to live up to it. But this can cause them to have unrealistic expectations for themselves. When these personalities fail to live up to these visions, they may accuse themselves of being useless or selfish or woefully inadequate. Taken too far, this self-criticism can discourage INFPs, leading them to give up on even their dearest dreams.

-Protagonist
    ENFJ Personality
    Protagonists are inspiring optimists, readily taking action to do what they feel is right.
    Introduction
    Who is the Protagonist personality type?

    ENFJ (Protagonist) is a personality type with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging traits. These warm, forthright types love helping others, and they tend to have strong ideas and values. They back their perspective with the creative energy to achieve their goals.

    When the whole world is silent, even one voice becomes powerful.

    MALALA YOUSAFZAI
    People with the ENFJ personality type (Protagonists) feel called to serve a greater purpose in life. Thoughtful and idealistic, ENFJs strive to have a positive impact on other people and the world around them. These personalities rarely shy away from an opportunity to do the right thing, even when doing so is far from easy.

    ENFJ (Protagonist) personality
    ENFJs are born leaders, which explains why these personalities can be found among many notable politicians, coaches, and teachers. Their passion and charisma allow them to inspire others not just in their careers but in every arena of their lives, including their relationships. Few things bring people with the ENFJ personality type a deeper sense of joy and fulfillment than guiding friends and loved ones to grow into their best selves.

    ENFJs possess the unique ability to remain hopeful in the face of difficulties, always remembering that there is something to be grateful for.
    Speaking Up for What’s Right
    ENFJs tend to be vocal about their values, including authenticity and altruism. When something strikes them as unjust or wrong, they speak up. But they rarely come across as brash or pushy, as their sensitivity and insight guide them to speak in ways that resonate with others.

    ENFJ personalities have not only an uncanny ability to pick up on people’s underlying motivations and beliefs but also a knack for understanding how others are feeling just by looking at them. At times, they may not even understand how they come to grasp another person’s mind and heart so quickly. These flashes of insight can make ENFJs incredibly persuasive and inspiring communicators.

    ENFJ personalities possess an innate sense of justice and an unwavering commitment to standing up against what they perceive as wrong.
    This personality type’s secret weapon is their purity of intent. Generally speaking, ENFJs are motivated by a sincere wish to do the right thing rather than a desire to manipulate or have power over other people. Even when they disagree with someone, they search for common ground. The result is that people with the ENFJ personality type can communicate with an eloquence and sensitivity that are nearly impossible to ignore – particularly when they speak about matters that are close to their hearts.

    Getting Involved
    ENFJ personalities are genuine, caring people who talk the talk and walk the walk. Nothing makes them happier than motivating others to do what’s right.
    When ENFJs care about someone, they want to help solve that person’s problems – sometimes at any cost. The good news is that many people are grateful for this assistance and advice. After all, there’s a reason that these personalities have a reputation for helping others improve their lives.

    But getting involved in other people’s problems isn’t always a recipe for success. ENFJs tend to have a clear vision of what people can or should do in order to better themselves, but not everyone is ready to make those changes. If they push too hard, their loved ones may feel resentful or unfairly judged. And while this personality type is known for being insightful, even the wisest ENFJs may sometimes misread a situation or unwittingly give bad advice.

    Leading the Way
    People with this personality type are devoted altruists, ready to face slings and arrows in order to stand up for the people and ideas that they believe in. This strength of conviction bolsters an ENFJ’s ability to guide others to work together in service of the greater good.

    But their greatest gift might actually be leading by example. In their day-to-day lives, ENFJs reveal how seemingly ordinary situations can be handled with compassion, dedication, and care. For these personalities, even the smallest daily choices and actions – from how they spend their weekend to what they say to a coworker who is struggling – can become an opportunity to lead the way to a brighter future.


    -ENFJ Strengths
        ENFJ (Protagonist) strengths
        Receptive – People with the ENFJ personality type (Protagonists) have strong opinions, but they’re far from closed-minded. They recognize the importance of allowing others to express themselves fully. Even when they don’t agree with someone, they recognize that person’s right to voice their truth.
        Reliable – Few things bother ENFJs more than the prospect of letting down a person or cause that they believe in. People with this personality type can be counted on to see their promises and responsibilities through – even when it’s difficult to do so.
        Passionate – ENFJ personalities brim with interests, and they take great pleasure in pursuing their hobbies – whether that’s hiking, cooking, dancing, growing houseplants, or something else entirely. As a result, they rarely find themselves at a loss for something interesting to do.
        Altruistic – ENFJs are known for harboring a deep desire to be a force for positive change in both their personal lives and their professional pursuits. Their unwavering inclination toward fairness often compels people with this personality type to advocate for those who are unable to do so for themselves. Their joy lies in seeing those around them thrive, making their altruism heartfelt and sincere.
        Charismatic – Determined and inspiring, ENFJs often find their way into leadership roles. Whether they’re captain of their softball team or a leader on the world stage, they excel at engaging in conversation, captivating people’s attention, and rallying people together behind a common goal. ENFJ personalities also have a profound capacity for empathy that oftentimes causes the people they come across to feel truly seen and valued, further bolstering their natural allure.
    -ENFJ Weaknesses
        ENFJ (Protagonist) weaknesses
        Unrealistic – Many ENFJs put pressure on themselves to right every wrong that they encounter. But no matter how hard these personalities try, it just isn’t realistic for them to solve all of the world’s problems. If they aren’t careful, they can spread themselves too thin – and be left unable to help anyone.
        Overly Idealistic – ENFJ personalities tend to have clear ideas about what’s right and what’s wrong. They often think that everyone shares these fundamental principles – or, at least, that everyone should share these principles. So it can come as a genuine shock to ENFJs when people violate their core values, such as truth or justice.
        Condescending – People with this personality type enjoy teaching others, particularly about the causes and beliefs that matter so much to them. But at times, ENFJs’ attempts to “enlighten” others may come across as patronizing – not the most effective strategy for persuading other people, unfortunately.
        Intense – When it comes to self-improvement, ENFJs are rarely short on energy or determination. But they may not recognize that not everyone shares these qualities. At times, these personalities may push others to make changes that they aren’t ready for – or simply aren’t interested in making in the first place.
        Overly Empathetic – Compassion is among this personality type’s greatest strengths. But ENFJs have a tendency to take on other people’s problems as their own – a habit that can leave them emotionally and physically exhausted.

-Campaigner
    ENFP Personality
    Campaigners are enthusiastic, creative, and sociable free spirits, who can always find a reason to smile.
    Introduction
    Who is the Campaigner personality type?

    ENFP (Campaigner) is a personality type with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting traits. These people tend to embrace big ideas and actions that reflect their sense of hope and goodwill toward others. Their vibrant energy can flow in many directions.

    It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for – and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart’s longing.

    ORIAH MOUNTAIN DREAMER
    People with the ENFP personality type (Campaigners) are true free spirits – outgoing, openhearted, and open-minded. With their lively, upbeat approach to life, ENFPs stand out in any crowd. But even though they can be the life of the party, they don’t just care about having a good time. These personalities have profound depths that are fueled by their intense desire for meaningful, emotional connections with others.

    ENFP (Campaigner) personality
    The Magic of Everyday Life
    ENFP personalities carry an interesting blend of carefree sociability, sparkling imagination, and deep, contemplative introspection. They regularly use their natural curiosity and expansive creativity to try to better understand themselves and the complex dynamics of human relationships. And they are truly devoted to nurturing their relationships with and their understanding of the world at large.

    In their unique way, ENFPs’ introspective nature is driven by their imagination, wonder, and belief in things that cannot always be explained rationally. People with this personality type truly believe that everything – and everyone – is connected, and they live for the glimmers of insight that they can gain from these connections. They believe that how we treat one another really matters. In fact, ENFPs are the most likely personality type to believe in the concept of karma.

    ENFPs are independent and creative, always on the lookout for the magic and meaning in everyday life. They can’t help but ponder the deeper significance of life – even when they should be paying attention to something else.
    When something sparks their imagination, ENFPs show an enthusiasm that is nothing short of infectious. These personalities can’t help but to radiate a positive energy that draws other people in. Consequently, they might find themselves being held up by their peers as a leader or guru. However, once their initial bloom of inspiration wears off, ENFPs can struggle with self-discipline and consistency, losing steam on projects that once meant so much to them.

    Seeking Joy
    ENFP personalities are proof that seeking out life’s joys and pleasures isn’t the same as being shallow. Seemingly in the blink of an eye, people with this personality type can transform from impassioned idealists to carefree figures on the dance floor.

    ENFP personalities are capable of intense thought and feeling – and also of kicking back and having a good time.
    Even in moments of fun, ENFPs want to connect emotionally with others. Few things matter more to these personalities than having genuine, heartfelt conversations with the people they cherish. ENFPs believe that everyone deserves to express their feelings, and their empathy and warmth create spaces where even the most timid spirits can feel comfortable opening up.

    ENFPs need to be careful, however. Their intuition may lead them to read far too much into other people’s actions and behaviors. Instead of simply asking for an explanation, they may end up puzzling over someone else’s desires or intentions. This kind of social stress is what keeps harmony-focused ENFP personalities awake at night.

    ENFPs will spend a lot of time exploring different relationships, feelings, and ideas before they find a path for their life that feels right. But when they do finally find their way, their imagination, empathy, and courage can light up not only their own life but also the world around them.

    -ENFP Strengths
        ENFP (Campaigner) strengths
        Curious – People with the ENFP personality type (Campaigners) can find beauty and fascination in nearly anything. Imaginative and open-minded, ENFP personalities aren’t afraid to venture beyond their comfort zone in search of new ideas, experiences, and adventures. Moreover, their curiosity extends beyond simply seeking novelty. They also have a deep desire to understand how things work and why they are the way they are.
        Perceptive – To people with this personality type, no one is unimportant – which might explain how they can pick up on even the subtlest shifts in another person’s mood or expression. Because they’re so sensitive to other people’s feelings and needs, ENFPs can make full use of their caring, considerate nature.
        Enthusiastic – When something captures their imagination and inspires them, ENFP personalities want to share it with anyone who will listen. And they’re just as eager to hear other people’s ideas and opinions – even if those thoughts are wildly different from their own.
        Excellent Communicators – People with the ENFP personality type brim with things to say, but they can be caring listeners as well. This gives them a nearly unmatched ability to have positive and enjoyable conversations with all sorts of people – even people who aren’t particularly sociable or agreeable.
        Easygoing – ENFPs may live for deep, meaningful conversations, but they can also be spontaneous and lighthearted. These personalities know how to find fun and joy in the present moment – and few things give them more pleasure than sharing their joy with others.
        Good-Natured and Positive – All of these strengths come together to form a person who is warmhearted and approachable, with an altruistic spirit and a friendly disposition. ENFPs strive to get along with pretty much everyone, and their circles of acquaintances and friends often stretch far and wide.
    -ENFP Weaknesses
        ENFP (Campaigner) weaknesses
        People-Pleasing – Most people with the ENFP personality type are uncomfortable with the prospect of being disliked. To maintain the peace, they may compromise on things that matter to them or allow others to treat them poorly. And when they fail to win someone over, they might lose sleep trying to figure out what to do about it.
        Unfocused – The thrill of a new project – especially one that involves collaborating with other people – can bring out the best in these personalities. But ENFPs are known for having ever-evolving interests, meaning that they may find it challenging to maintain discipline and focus over the long term.
        Disorganized – ENFPs’ focus on the big picture and their love for exploring new ideas and experiences can sometimes overshadow their attention to everyday practical matters. Specifically, people with this personality type may try to avoid the routine tasks that they view as boring like household chores, basic maintenance, or paperwork. The resulting sense of disorganization can become a major source of stress in their life.
        Overly Accommodating – ENFP personalities feel called to uplift others, and they may find themselves saying yes whenever anyone asks them for guidance or help. But unless they set boundaries, even the most energetic among them can become overcommitted, with too little time and energy to tackle the necessities of their own life.
        Overly Optimistic – Optimism can be among this personality type’s key strengths. But ENFPs’ rosy outlook can lead them to make well-intentioned but naive decisions, such as believing people who haven’t earned their trust. This trait can also make it difficult for these personalities to accept hard but necessary truths – and to share those truths with others.
        Restless – With their positive, upbeat attitude, ENFPs rarely seem upset or dissatisfied on the outside. But their inner idealism can leave them with a nagging feeling that some major areas of their life just aren’t good enough – whether that’s their work, their home life, or their relationships.

    Logisticians are practical and fact-minded individuals, whose reliability cannot be doubted.
    Introduction
    Who is the Logistician personality type?

    ISTJ (Logistician) is a personality type with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging traits. These people tend to be reserved yet willful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose.

    I’d be more frightened by not using whatever abilities I’d been given. I’d be more frightened by procrastination and laziness.

    DENZEL WASHINGTON
    People with the ISTJ personality type (Logisticians) mean what they say and say what they mean, and when they commit to doing something, they make sure to follow through. With their responsible and dependable nature, it might not be so surprising that ISTJ personalities also tend to have a deep respect for structure and tradition. They are often drawn to organizations, workplaces, and educational settings that offer clear hierarchies and expectations.

    While ISTJs may not be particularly flashy or attention seeking, they do more than their share to keep society on a sturdy, stable foundation. In their families and their communities, people with this personality type often earn respect for their reliability, their practicality, and their ability to stay grounded and logical in even the most stressful situations.

    ISTJ (Logistician) personality
    True to their methodical nature, ISTJs often steer clear of impulsive behaviors, instead favoring careful deliberation when it comes to decision-making of any kind.
    A Life of Integrity
    People with the ISTJ personality type believe that there is a right way to proceed in any situation – and that anyone who pretends otherwise is probably trying to bend the rules to suit their own desires. Consequently, they rarely hesitate to take responsibility for their actions and choices. They are quick to own up to their mistakes, admitting the truth even if it doesn’t make them look good or if it makes other people uncomfortable. To ISTJ personalities, honesty and straightforward communication are far more important than showmanship. They’d rather satisfy their own conscience than lie to impress someone else.

    In a world where many people shirk their responsibilities or say what they think others want to hear, ISTJs stand out as dedicated, responsible, and honest.
    ISTJ personalities are also known for striving to meet their obligations no matter what. And they are often baffled by people who fail to hold themselves to the same standard. They can sometimes unfairly misjudge people who don’t match their rigorous self-control – suspecting that someone is being lazy or dishonest when that person might actually be coping with other challenges. While this can sometimes make ISTJ personalities appear rigid or unempathetic, their judgment often stems from their unwavering commitment to reliability and structure.

    Picking Up the Slack
    ISTJs’ dedication is an admirable quality, and it drives many of their accomplishments. But it can also become a weakness that other people take advantage of. With their strong work ethic and sense of duty, they may routinely find themselves shouldering other people’s responsibilities. Even if they don’t complain about the situation, ISTJ personalities can end up exhausted or discouraged if they’re constantly expected – or take it upon themselves – to pick up the slack for their colleagues, friends, or loved ones.

    ISTJs may often find themselves doing others’ work – and not getting credit for it.
    ISTJ personalities aren’t known for expressing their emotions readily, but that doesn’t mean that they don’t feel frustration or resentment when they’re pulling more than their weight. And unless they make sure that their relationships are balanced and sustainable, they may end up compromising the very stability that they feel called to protect. The good news is that, by learning to set appropriate boundaries and speak up when they’re overstretched, people with the ISTJ personality type can offer the world the full benefit of their many gifts, including their clarity, their loyalty, and their dependability.

    -ISTJ Strengths
        ISTJ (Logistician) strengths
        Honest and Direct – Integrity is at the heart of people with the ISTJ personality type (Logisticians). Emotional manipulation, mind games, and lies of any kind all run counter to their preference for managing the reality of the situations that they encounter with plain and simple honesty.
        Disciplined – ISTJs embody integrity through both their words and their actions. Patient and determined, people with this personality type meet their obligations and keep their promises, period. They value structure, follow rules strictly, and respect authority, showcasing their strong will and dutiful nature.
        Very Responsible – ISTJs would rather power through and lose sleep than fail to deliver the results that they said they would. Loyal and reliable, they almost always fulfill their duties to the people and organizations that they’ve committed themselves to, and they do so on time and with strict adherence to whatever guidelines were set in place.
        Calm and Practical – None of their promises would mean much if ISTJ personalities lost their tempers and broke down at every sign of hardship – they tend to keep their feet on the ground and make clear, rational decisions. Other people’s preferences might be taken into consideration in the process, but ultimately, their decisions are made with practicality in mind.
        Organized and Effective – The primary goal of any ISTJ personality is to be effective in what they’ve chosen to do, and they believe that this is accomplished best when everyone involved knows exactly what is going on and why. Clear rules and regulations help people with this personality type maintain order and work in a productive manner.
        Research-Oriented – ISTJs are proud repositories of knowledge, with an emphasis on procedures and techniques that enable reliable outcomes. This allows ISTJ personalities to apply themselves to a variety of situations with success, picking up and applying new data as needed to maintain functionality.
    -ISTJ Weaknesses
        ISTJ (Logistician) weaknesses
        Stubborn – The facts are the facts, and people with the ISTJ personality type tend to resist any new idea that isn’t supported by those facts. This factual decision-making process makes it difficult for them to accept that they were wrong about something – but anyone can miss a detail, even ISTJs.
        Insensitive – While not intentionally harsh, ISTJs often hurt more sensitive types’ feelings by the simple mantra that honesty is the best policy. These personalities may take emotions into consideration, but really only so far as to determine the most effective way to say what needs to be said.
        Always by the Book – ISTJs believe that things work best with clearly defined rules, but this makes them reluctant to bend those rules or try new things even when the downside is minimal. Truly unstructured environments tend to leave these personalities stressed and dissatisfied.
        Judgmental – Because ISTJs tend to highly value facts and empirical evidence, they are unlikely to respect people who disagree with proven information – especially those who remain willfully ignorant. When others disregard concrete evidence and instead rely on assumptions or emotions, ISTJs can become judgmental, viewing these individuals as irrational or misguided.
        Prone to Burnout – All this can combine to make people with the ISTJ personality type believe that they are the only ones who can see projects through reliably. As they load themselves with extra work and responsibilities, turning away good intentions and helpful ideas, they sooner or later hit a tipping point where they simply can’t deliver. Since they’ve heaped the responsibility on themselves, ISTJs may then believe that the responsibility for failure is theirs alone to bear.

-Defender
    ISFJ Personality
    Defenders are very dedicated and warm protectors, always ready to defend their loved ones.
    Introduction
    Who is the Defender personality type?

    ISFJ (Defender) is a personality type with the Introverted, Observant, Feeling, and Judging traits. These people tend to be warm and unassuming in their own steady way. They’re efficient and responsible, giving careful attention to practical details in their daily lives.

    Love only grows by sharing. You can only have more for yourself by giving it away to others.

    Brian Tracy
    In their unassuming, understated way, people with the ISFJ personality type (Defenders) help make the world go round. Hardworking and devoted, these personalities feel a deep sense of responsibility to those around them. ISFJs can be counted on to meet deadlines, remember birthdays and special occasions, uphold traditions, and shower their loved ones with gestures of care and support. But they rarely demand recognition for all that they do, preferring instead to operate behind the scenes.

    This is a capable, can-do personality type with a wealth of versatile gifts. Though sensitive and caring, ISFJs also have excellent analytical abilities and an eye for detail. And despite their reserve, they tend to have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships. These personalities are truly more than the sum of their parts, and their varied strengths shine in even the most ordinary aspects of their daily lives.

    ISFJ (Defender) personality
    ISFJs are true altruists, meeting kindness with kindness-in-excess and engaging with the work and people they believe in with enthusiasm and generosity.
    The Gift of Loyalty
    One of the greatest ISFJ strengths is loyalty. They rarely allow a friendship or relationship to fade away from lack of effort. Instead, they invest a great deal of energy into maintaining strong connections with their loved ones – and not just by sending “How are you doing?” texts. People with this personality type are known for dropping everything and lending a hand whenever a friend or family member is going through a hard time.

    ISFJ personalities tend to feel most energized and effective when they’re showing up for someone who needs their help. And their sense of loyalty doesn’t stop with their nearest and dearest – it often extends to their communities, their employers, and even family traditions. But the intensity of their commitment and desire to serve can have its downsides.

    Other people may take advantage of ISFJs’ helpful, hardworking nature, leaving them feeling burned out and overworked. And these personalities may feel guilty or stressed when they contemplate saying no or making changes – even necessary changes – to themselves, their relationships, or the way that they’ve done things in the past.

    A notable ISFJ weakness is that they often find change difficult – particularly when it’s sudden or involves unfamiliar territory. In fact, they are the most likely personality type to feel stressed out by last minute changes.
    The Highest of Standards
    For ISFJs, “good enough” is rarely good enough. People with this personality type can be meticulous to the point of perfectionism. They take their responsibilities seriously, consistently going above and beyond and doing everything that they can to exceed others’ expectations.

    Despite their hard work and consistency, ISFJ personalities are still known for their humility. They rarely seek the spotlight for the things they do. But that doesn’t mean that they are okay with being unnoticed or unappreciated.

    While ISFJs tend to underplay their accomplishments, that doesn’t mean that they don’t enjoy recognition – or that they’re fine with being taken for granted. Unless they learn to stand up for themselves, people with this personality type may find themselves quietly losing their enthusiasm and motivation, eventually becoming resentful toward those who just don’t seem to appreciate them.

    Showing Up for Others – and Themselves
    Although they’re Introverted, ISFJ personalities have a deeply social nature. Thanks to their ability to remember the details of other people’s lives, they have a special talent for making their friends and acquaintances feel seen, known, and cherished. Few personality types can match their ability to choose just the right gift for any occasion, whether large or small.

    Dedicated and thoughtful, ISFJs find great joy in helping those around them build stable, secure, and happy lives. It may not be easy for people with this personality type to show up for themselves in the way that they show up for others, but when they do, they often find themselves with even more energy and motivation to do good in the world.

    -ISFJ Strengths
        ISFJ (Defender) strengths
        Supportive – People with the ISFJ personality type (Defenders) truly enjoy helping others, and they happily share their knowledge, attention, and expertise with anyone who needs it. ISFJs strive for win-win situations, choosing teamwork over competition whenever possible.
        Reliable – Rather than working in sporadic, excited bursts that leave things half finished, ISFJ personalities are meticulous and careful. They take a steady approach, ensuring that things are done to the highest standard – often going well beyond what is required. Further, most ISFJs agree that sustaining discipline and reliability becomes easier with time.
        Observant – ISFJ personalities have a talent for noticing things, particularly about other people. They pay attention to the smallest details of what someone says and does, giving them unexpected insights into other people’s lives and emotions.
        Enthusiastic – When the goal is right, ISFJs apply all of their gifts to something that they believe will make a real, positive difference in people’s lives – whether that’s fighting poverty with a global initiative or simply making a customer’s day at work.
        Hardworking – ISFJs don’t just get their work done – they take pride in going above and beyond all of their tasks and responsibilities. People with this personality type often form an emotional attachment to the projects and organizations that they’ve dedicated themselves to, and they won’t rest until they’ve done their share – or more than their share – to be of help.
        Good Practical Skills – The ISFJ personality type offers the rare combination of an altruistic nature and hard-won practicality. They don’t just hope to help others. They take action – meaning that they’re more than happy to roll up their sleeves and do what’s necessary to care for their friends, family, and anyone else who needs it.
    -ISFJ Weaknesses
        ISFJ (Defender) weaknesses
        Overly Humble – ISFJs are so concerned with other people’s feelings that they may refuse to make their thoughts known or to take any duly earned credit for their contributions. They often downplay their efforts entirely when they think that they could have done some minor aspect of a task better.
        Taking Things Personally – Although they might try to hide it, people with this personality type are deeply sensitive to others’ opinions, and they can be thrown off-balance if someone doesn’t appreciate, approve of, or agree with them. When they encounter criticism or disagreement – even if it’s well-intentioned – ISFJs may feel as if they’re experiencing a personal attack.
        Repressing Their Feelings – Private and reserved, ISFJ personalities tend to internalize their feelings, particularly negative ones. This can create misunderstandings in their relationships. Eventually, all of their repressed feelings and resentments may boil over in a sudden, uncharacteristic outburst of frustration.
        Reluctant to Change – ISFJs are among the personality types that struggle the most with change. Breaking with tradition isn’t easy for these steady personalities, who place great value on history and precedent. Even when change is necessary, they may wait until the situation reaches a breaking point before altering course.
        Too Altruistic – ISFJs’ giving, generous nature can leave them vulnerable to being taken advantage of by others. It can be hard for them to rock the boat and stand up to someone who isn’t pulling their own weight. In fact, ISFJs are the most likely personality type to say they would rather clean up someone else’s mess than confront them about it directly.

-Executive
    ESTJ Personality
    Executives are excellent organizers, unsurpassed at managing things – or people.
    Introduction
    Who is the Executive personality type?

    ESTJ (Executive) is a personality type with the Extraverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging traits. They possess great fortitude, emphatically following their own sensible judgment. They often serve as a stabilizing force among others, able to offer solid direction amid adversity.

    Good order is the foundation of all things.

    Edmund Burke
    People with the ESTJ personality type (Executives) are representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their understanding of what is right, wrong, and socially acceptable to bring families and communities together. Embracing the values of honesty and dedication, ESTJs are valued for their mentorship mindset and their ability to create and follow through on plans in a diligent and efficient manner. They will happily lead the way on difficult paths, and they won’t give up when things become stressful.

    ESTJs are classic images of the model citizen: they help their neighbors, uphold the law, and try to make sure that everyone participates in the communities and organizations that they hold so dear.
    ESTJ (Executive) personality
    Leading by Example
    Strong believers in the rule of law and authority that must be earned, ESTJ personalities lead by example, demonstrating dedication and purposeful honesty and an utter rejection of laziness and cheating. If anyone declares hard, manual work to be an excellent way to build character, it’s ESTJs.

    This personality type is aware of their surroundings and lives in a world of clear, verifiable facts. Their surety of their knowledge means that, even against heavy resistance, they stick to their principles and push an unclouded vision of what is and is not acceptable. And their opinions aren’t just empty talk either, as ESTJs are more than willing to dive into the most challenging projects, improving action plans and sorting details along the way, making even the most complicated tasks seem easy and approachable.

    People with the ESTJ personality type are dedicated individuals who pride themselves on always finishing what they start, rendering them reliable and trustworthy.
    However, ESTJs don’t work alone, and they expect their reliability and work ethic to be reciprocated – people with this personality type meet their promises, and if their partner or coworkers jeopardize them through incompetence, laziness, or, worse still, dishonesty, they do not hesitate to show their disappointment. This can earn them a reputation for inflexibility, but it’s not because ESTJs are arbitrarily stubborn but rather because they truly believe that these values are what make society work.

    A Greater Responsibility
    The main challenge for ESTJ personalities is to recognize that not everyone follows the same path or contributes in the same way. A true leader recognizes the strength of the individual as well as that of the group and helps bring those individuals’ ideas to the table. That way, ESTJs really do have all the facts and are able to lead the charge in directions that work for everyone.

    -ESTJ Strengths
        ESTJ (Executive) strengths
        Dedicated – Seeing things to completion borders on an ethical obligation for people with the ESTJ personality type (Executives). Tasks aren’t simply abandoned because they’ve become difficult or boring. Often refusing to cut corners or shirk responsibilities, they showcase their dedication through their unwavering commitment to high standards. In fact, they tend to strive for perfection in most things that they take on in life.
        Strong-willed – A strong will makes this dedication possible, and ESTJs don’t give up their beliefs because of simple opposition. They defend their ideas and principles relentlessly and must be proven clearly and conclusively wrong for their stance to budge.
        Direct and Honest – ESTJs trust facts far more than abstract ideas or opinions. Straightforward statements and information are king, and people with this personality type return the honesty (whether it’s wanted or not).
        Loyal, Patient, and Reliable – ESTJs work to exemplify truthfulness and reliability, considering stability and security very important. When ESTJs say they’ll do something, they keep their word, making them very responsible members of their families, companies, and communities.
        Enjoy Creating Order – Chaos makes things unpredictable, and unpredictable things can’t be trusted when they are needed most. With this in mind, ESTJs strive to create order and security in their environments by establishing rules, structures, and clear roles. They tend to exemplify this need for order in their home lives as well, as they are the most likely personality type to have a very structured schedule that includes fixed times for waking up and going to sleep.
        Excellent Organizers – A commitment to truth and clear standards makes ESTJs capable and confident leaders. People with this personality type have no problem distributing tasks and responsibilities to others fairly and objectively, making them excellent administrators.
    -ESTJ Weaknesses
        ESTJ (Executive) weaknesses
        Inflexible and Stubborn – The problem with being so fixated on what works is that they too often dismiss what might work better. Everything is opinion until proven, and ESTJ personalities are reluctant to trust an opinion long enough for it to have that chance.
        Uncomfortable with Change – ESTJs are strong adherents to tradition. When suddenly forced to try unvetted solutions, they become uncomfortable and stressed. New ideas suggest that their methods weren’t good enough, and abandoning what has always worked before in favor of something that may yet fail risks their image of reliability.
        Judgmental – People with the ESTJ personality type have strong convictions about what is right, wrong, and socially acceptable, and their compulsion to create order often extends to all things and everyone, ignoring the possibility that there is more than one right way to get things done. They do not hesitate to let people they disagree with know what they think, considering it their duty to set things right.
        Too Focused on Social Status – ESTJs take pride in the respect of their friends, colleagues, and community, and while difficult to admit, they are very concerned with public opinion. These personalities can get caught up in meeting others’ expectations, failing to address their own needs.
        Difficulty Relaxing – This need for respect fosters a need to maintain their dignity, which can make it difficult for ESTJs to cut loose and relax for risk of dropping the ball or looking the fool, even in good fun.
        Difficulty Expressing Emotion – People with the ESTJ personality type get so caught up in the facts and most effective methods that they forget to think of what makes others happy – they forget to express emotions and empathy. For example, a detour can be breathtakingly beautiful and a joy for the family, but this type may only see the consequence of arriving at their destination an hour late, hurting their loved ones by rejecting the notion too harshly.

-Consul
    ESFJ Personality
    Consuls are very caring, social, community-minded people who are always eager to help.
    Introduction
    Who is the Consul personality type?

    ESFJ (Consul) is a personality type with the Extraverted, Observant, Feeling, and Judging traits. They are attentive and people-focused, and they enjoy taking part in their social community. Their achievements are guided by decisive values, and they willingly offer guidance to others.

    Encourage, lift, and strengthen one another. For the positive energy spread to one will be felt by us all.

    Deborah Day
    For people with the ESFJ personality type (Consuls), life is sweetest when it’s shared with others. These social individuals form the bedrock of many communities, opening their homes – and their hearts – to friends, loved ones, and neighbors.

    This doesn’t mean that they are saints or that they like everyone. In fact, they are much more likely to form close bonds with people who share their same values and opinions. But regardless of other people’s beliefs, ESFJ personalities still strongly believe in the power of hospitality and good manners, and they tend to feel a sense of duty to those around them. Generous and reliable, they often take it upon themselves – in ways both large and small – to hold their families and their communities together.

    ESFJ (Consul) personality
    ESFJs have a talent for making the people in their lives feel supported, cared for, and secure.
    The Beauty of a Responsible Life
    People with the ESFJ personality type are altruists. They take seriously their responsibility to give back, serve others, and do the right thing. And they believe that there is a clear right thing to do in nearly every situation. While some personality types adopt a more lenient, live-and-let-live attitude, ESFJs may find it difficult to not judge when someone takes a path that strikes them as misguided. As a result, they often struggle to accept it when someone – particularly someone they care about – disagrees with them or chooses to walk a path that they do not understand.

    ESFJs have a clear moral compass – and it can be nothing short of baffling to them when other people’s actions don’t align with it.
    With their definite views on right and wrong, these personalities tend to be on the opinionated side. But these opinions aren’t arbitrary – they’re often based on a deep respect for tradition. ESFJs know that everything they do affects someone else, and they trust that established laws, protocols, and social norms will help them navigate their everyday lives in a way that is considerate and responsible toward others.

    Building Relationships That Last
    Supportive and outgoing, people with the ESFJ personality type can always be spotted at a party – they’re the ones fluttering around making sure that everyone is having a good time! But make no mistake: they don’t just breeze through other people’s lives. Loyal to the core, they build lasting relationships, and they can be counted on to show up whenever a helping hand – or a listening ear – is needed. In fact, knowing that there are people out there who rely on them and need them tends to fill the cups of these generous types.

    People with the ESFJ personality type rarely miss a birthday or holiday. Devoted to their relationships, they commit even the smallest details of their friends’ and loved ones’ lives to memory.
    With their love of order and structure, ESFJs prefer planned events to open-ended activities or spontaneous get-togethers – and they’re happy to host in order to ensure that everything goes smoothly. People with this personality type put a great deal of energy into making other people feel special and celebrated, and they might take it personally if someone doesn’t seem to appreciate their efforts.

    For many people with the ESFJ personality type, one of life’s greatest challenges is accepting that they can’t control anyone else’s thoughts or behavior – not even those who are nearest and dearest to them. Fortunately, they can find peace and fulfillment by focusing on what they do best: setting an example of care, consideration, and responsibility – and bringing people together in the process.

    -ESFJ Strengths
        ESFJ (Consul) strengths
        Strong Practical Skills – People with the ESFJ personality type (Consuls) are excellent managers of day-to-day tasks and routine maintenance, enjoying making sure that those who are close to them are well cared for.
        Strong Sense of Duty – ESFJs have a strong sense of responsibility and always strive to meet their obligations. This often makes them hardworking and efficient in the workplace and very loyal in their personal relationships. They also tend to uphold the traditions that they hold close to their heart with diligence and consistency.
        Very Loyal – Valuing stability and security very highly, ESFJs are eager to preserve the status quo, which makes them extremely loyal and trustworthy partners and employees. True pillars of any groups that they belong to – whether it is their family or a community club – people with this personality type can always be counted on to show up and lend a helping hand.
        Sensitive and Warm – ESFJs naturally offer others the security and stability that they themselves want and need. They tend to seek out harmony and care deeply about other people’s feelings, being careful not to offend or hurt others. They are strong team players, and win-win situations are the stuff that their smiles are made of.
        Good at Connecting with Others – These qualities come together to make ESFJ personalities social, confident, and generally well-liked. They have a strong need to “belong” and have no problem with small talk or following social cues in order to help them take an active role in their communities.
    -ESFJ Weaknesses
        ESFJ (Consul) weaknesses
        Worried about Their Social Status – ESFJs can become preoccupied with social status and influence, which affects many of the decisions that they make, potentially limiting their creativity and open-mindedness. They can tie too much of their identity to others’ expectations, losing a sense of themselves.
        Inflexible – ESFJ personalities place a lot of importance on what is socially acceptable and can be very cautious, even critical, of anything unconventional or outside the mainstream. They may also be unwilling to step out of their own comfort zone, usually for fear of being (or just appearing) different.
        Vulnerable to Criticism – It can be especially challenging to change these tendencies because they are so conflict averse. ESFJ personalities can become very defensive and hurt if someone, especially a person close to them, criticizes their habits, beliefs, or traditions.
        Often Too Needy – ESFJs need to hear and see a great deal of appreciation. If their efforts go unnoticed, these individuals may start fishing for compliments in an attempt to get reassurance of how much they are valued.
        Too Selfless – The other side of this is that ESFJ personalities sometimes try to establish their value with doting attention, something that can quickly overwhelm those who don’t need it, making it ultimately unwelcome. Furthermore, they often neglect their own needs in the process.


##############################################################################################################
-Virtuoso
    ISTP Personality
    Virtuosos are innovative and practical experimenters, masters of all kinds of tools.
    Introduction
    Who is the Virtuoso personality type?

    ISTP (Virtuoso) is a personality type with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting traits. They tend to have an individualistic mindset, pursuing goals without needing much external connection. They engage in life with inquisitiveness and personal skill, varying their approach as needed.

    I wanted to live the life, a different life. I didn’t want to go to the same place every day and see the same people and do the same job. I wanted interesting challenges.

    Harrison Ford
    People with the ISTP personality type (Virtuosos) love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the world around them with an impressive diligence, a casual curiosity, and a healthy dose of skepticism. They are natural makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it and learning from their environment as they go. They find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, leaving them just a little bit better than they were before.

    ISTP (Virtuoso) personality
    ISTPs prefer to approach problems directly, seeking straightforward solutions over convoluted troubleshooting methods. People with this personality type rely heavily on firsthand experience and trial and error as they execute their ideas and projects. And as they do so, they usually prefer to work at their own pace, on their own terms, and without unnecessary interruptions.

    This is not a type who is inclined to socialize beyond what is necessary as they try to accomplish their goals. In fact, ISTP personalities generally find regular socializing to be taxing. And when they do decide to get together with people, they will almost always choose smaller, more meaningful interactions over superficial networking.

    Direct & Decisive
    For all the mysteriousness heaped on them, with this type, what you see is what you get. Direct but reserved, calm but suddenly spontaneous, industrious but focused on their own priorities, people with the ISTP personality type can be a challenge to predict, even by their friends and loved ones. They can seem very steady for a while, but they tend to build up a store of impulsive energy that explodes without warning, taking their interests in bold new directions.

    ISTPs act spontaneously on a new interest, exploring its viability after they’ve shifted gears.
    Decisions made by ISTPs may largely stem from their rational nature and their sense of what feels practical for them at any given moment, but that doesn’t mean that they don’t get swept away by their passions from time to time. Once their flame is lit, they tend to commit their time and energy with an impressive intensity until another equally compelling, or perhaps more gratifying, opportunity arises. And when it does, people with this personality type have no qualms about walking away from projects or situations that seem unfruitful or drained of potential.

    One of the biggest issues that they are likely to face is that, because they often act out of haste, they might rub people the wrong way sometimes. ISTPs are not the type to sugarcoat their opinions or feelings. They tend to have a very straightforward communication style that is often misinterpreted as bluntness or a lack of sensitivity, but it is simply the way these genuine souls operate. ISTP personalities have no time for people-pleasing or unnecessary social niceties. With them, there is little need to question their motives.

    Defying the Rules
    ISTP personalities are truly a unique bunch. At their core, they are authentic individuals who march to the beat of their own drum rather than adhering to societal norms and rules. Their opportunistic outlook and direct approach to life tend to create a rich tapestry of experiences and interactions for people with this personality type – some incredibly frustrating and others extremely gratifying.

    Guided by their knowledge and the evidence at their disposal, ISTPs navigate life by feel and inspiration, often stepping away from predefined routines to follow their instincts. They are unbound by convention, preferring to chart their own course in all that they do.

    In essence, people with the ISTP personality type live life freely on their own terms, valuing personal autonomy above most things. Weaving their way through social expectations, they still find a way to color outside the lines. Their journey might not align with broader norms, but therein lies the strength and beauty of their unique perspective. Finding an environment where they can coexist with people who understand their need for freedom, space, and unpredictability will give them many happy years.

    -ISTP Strengths
        ISTP (Virtuoso) strengths
        Diligent and Observant – People with the ISTP personality type (Virtuosos) are usually up to their elbows in some project or another. As hands-on individuals, they love readily engaging with their environment and transforming their observations into practical solutions.
        Handy and Resourceful – This personality type is very imaginative when it comes to practical things, mechanics, crafts, and skills. Novel ideas come easily to ISTPs, and they love using their hands to put them into action.
        Spontaneous – They are generally able to go with the flow and think on their feet. This flexibility comes with some unpredictability, but ISTPs are able to store their spontaneity for a rainy day, releasing their energy just when it’s needed most.
        Direct and Authentic – ISTPs value straightforward and honest communication. They speak their mind without sugarcoating, reflecting their authenticity. This directness often fosters clarity in their relationships and helps them advocate for their wants and needs.
        Independent – Very self-reliant individuals, ISTPs thrive on regularly undertaking tasks alone, which helps them foster their creativity along with strong problem-solving abilities.
        Grounded – ISTPs have the uncanny ability to stay rooted in the present moment. With a keen focus on what’s happening now, this personality type is less likely to get swept up in hypothetical future scenarios or past regrets.
    -ISTP Weaknesses
        ISTP (Virtuoso) weaknesses
        Unapologetic – As easily as ISTPs go with the flow, people with this personality type can also ignore it entirely and move in another direction with little consideration for others’ preferences. If someone tries to propose a different direction, ISTPs can become quite blunt in their irritation.
        Insensitive – ISTPs rely on logic, and even when they try to meet others halfway with empathy and emotional sensitivity, it rarely seems to come out quite right, if anything is even said at all.
        Private and Reserved – This personality type is notoriously difficult to get to know. They keep their personal matters to themselves and often just prefer silence to small talk.
        Easily Bored – ISTPs enjoy novelty, which makes them excellent tinkerers, but they are much less reliable when it comes to focusing on things as novelty wanes. Once something is understood, they tend to simply move on to something new and more interesting.
        Independent – While also listed as a strength, ISTP personalities’ independence can be a challenge in their social relationships, including in romance. Having someone else’s schedule – especially a social calendar – imposed on them is unlikely to sit well for long. Their tolerance can be quite low for having others take their time away from what they’d prefer to be doing.
        Overly Skeptical – ISTPs’ generally skeptical outlook can help them avoid unfounded assumptions, but unchecked skepticism may lead them to dismiss more subjective truths or unquantifiable aspects of the human experience. It can also lead to missed opportunities – they may not take risks or explore unfamiliar concepts due to a lack of definitive proof. Similarly, excessive skepticism may also strain social relationships due to perceived negativity and lack of trust.

-Adventurer
    ISFP Personality
    Adventurers are flexible and charming, always ready to explore and experience something new.
    Introduction
    Who is the Adventurer personality type?

    ISFP (Adventurer) is a personality type with the Introverted, Observant, Feeling, and Prospecting traits. They tend to have open minds, approaching life, new experiences, and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the moment helps them uncover exciting potentials.

    I change during the course of a day. I wake and I’m one person, and when I go to sleep I know for certain I’m somebody else.

    Bob Dylan
    People with the ISFP personality type (Adventurers) are true artists – although not necessarily in the conventional sense. For these types, life itself is a canvas for self-expression. From what they wear to how they spend their free time, they act in ways that vividly reflect who they are as unique individuals. With their exploratory spirit and their ability to find joy in everyday life, ISFPs can be among the most interesting people you’ll ever meet.

    Driven by their sense of fairness and their open-mindedness, people with this personality type move through life with an infectiously encouraging attitude. They love motivating those close to them to follow their passions and usually follow their own interests with the same unhindered enthusiasm. The only irony? Unassuming and humble, ISFPs tend to see themselves as “just doing their own thing,” so they may not even realize how remarkable they really are.

    ISFP (Adventurer) personality
    The Beauty of an Open Mind
    These individuals embrace a flexible, adaptable approach to life. Some personalities thrive on strict schedules and routines – but not ISFPs. They prefer to take each day as it comes, doing what feels right to them in the moment. And they make sure to leave plenty of room in their lives for the unexpected – with the result that many of their most cherished memories are of spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment outings and adventures, whether by themselves or with their loved ones.

    This flexible mindset makes ISFP personalities remarkably tolerant and nonjudgmental. They genuinely appreciate the diverse nature of the world, embracing people who may hold different opinions or practice unique lifestyles. It’s no surprise, then, that they rarely try to convince people to change who they are or what they believe in.

    ISFPs want to live in a world where they – and everyone else – have the freedom to live as they see fit, without judgment.
    That said, their go-with-the-flow mentality can have its downsides. People with this personality type may struggle to set long-term plans – let alone stick with them. As a result, ISFPs sometimes have a pretty cloudy view of their ability to achieve their goals, and they often worry about letting other people down. They may find that adding a little structure to their lives goes a long way toward helping them feel more capable and organized – without quashing their independent spirits.

    Living in Harmony
    In their relationships, ISFPs are warm, friendly, and caring, taking wholehearted enjoyment in the company of their nearest and dearest. But make no mistake: they need dedicated alone time to recharge their energy after socializing with others. This alone time is what allows these personalities to reestablish a sense of their own identity – in other words, to reconnect with who they truly are.

    Creative and free-spirited, people with this personality type march to the beat of their own drum. It would be easy to assume that they don’t particularly worry about what others think of them, but oftentimes, this isn’t the case. ISFPs are thoughtful and perceptive, able to pick up on people’s unspoken feelings and opinions, and it can upset them if they don’t feel liked, approved of, or appreciated. Their emotional receptivity and genuinely sensitive nature might be part of the reason why they tend to be so accepting and forgiving of others. If any personality type believes in giving something (or someone) a second chance, it’s ISFPs.

    Despite the challenges that they may face due to their sensitivity, ISFPs live in the present, and they know that they don’t need to dwell on past hurts or frustrations. Rather than focusing on how things could be different, people with this personality type have an incredible capacity for appreciating what’s right about life just as it is. Everywhere they look, they can find sources of beauty and enjoyment that others might miss – and this perspective is just one of the many gifts that they share with the world.

    -ISFP Strengths
        ISFP (Adventurer) strengths
        Charming – People with the ISFP personality type (Adventurers) are relaxed and warm, and their “live and let live” attitude naturally makes them likable and popular.
        Sensitive to Others – ISFPs easily relate to others’ emotions, helping them establish harmony and goodwill and minimize conflict. Many people with this personality type are even able to perceive others’ emotions just by listening to their voices.
        Kind and Encouraging – These individuals possess an innate kindness and fairness that fuels their understanding and empathy toward others and often helps them to create a safe space for others to express their thoughts and feelings. They generally adopt an encouraging disposition, always ready to cheer others on in the pursuit of their passions.
        Imaginative – ISFPs use creativity and insight to craft bold ideas that speak to people’s hearts. While it’s hard to explain this quality on a resume, their vivid imagination and exploratory spirit help people with this personality type in unexpected ways.
        Passionate – Beneath their quiet shyness beats an intensely feeling heart. When these personalities are caught up in something exciting and interesting, they can leave everything else in the dust.
    -ISFP Weaknesses
        ISFP (Adventurer) weaknesses
        Difficulty with Structure – Freedom of expression is often ISFP personalities’ top priority. Anything that interferes with that, like traditions and hard rules, creates a sense of oppression. This can make more rigidly structured contexts a challenge.
        Unpredictable – ISFPs dislike long-term commitments and plans. The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can cause strain in their romantic relationships and financial hardship later in life.
        Easily Stressed – People with the ISFP personality type live in the present, full of emotion. When situations get out of control, they can shut down, losing their characteristic charm and creativity in favor of gnashing teeth.
        Difficulty with Technical Problem-Solving – ISFPs are not the type to build, repair, or try a hands-on approach when faced with technical issues. Their preference for observation over direct, practical involvement often holds them back from dealing effectively with mechanical or technical problem-solving.
        Fluctuating Self-Esteem – It’s demanded that skills be quantified, but that’s hard to do with ISFP personalities’ strengths of sensitivity and exploration. Their efforts are too often dismissed, a hurtful and damaging blow, especially early in life. These individuals can start to believe the naysayers without strong support.

-Entrepreneur
    ESTP Personality
    Entrepreneurs are savvy, energetic, and very perceptive people who truly enjoy living on the edge.
    Introduction
    Who is the Entrepreneur personality type?

    ESTP (Entrepreneur) is a personality type with the Extraverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting traits. They tend to be energetic and action-oriented, deftly navigating whatever is in front of them. They love uncovering life’s opportunities, whether socializing with others or in more personal pursuits.

    Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.

    Helen Keller
    People with the ESTP personality type (Entrepreneurs) are vibrant individuals brimming with an enthusiastic and spontaneous energy. They tend to be on the competitive side, often assuming that a competitive mindset is a necessity in order to achieve success in life. With their driven, action-oriented attitudes, they rarely waste time thinking about the past. In fact, they excel at keeping their attention rooted in their present – so much so that they rarely find themselves fixated on the time throughout the day.

    Theory, abstract concepts, and plodding discussions about global issues and their implications don’t keep ESTP personalities interested for long. They keep their conversations energetic, with a good dose of intelligence, but they like to talk about what is – or better yet, to just go out and do it. They often leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go rather than sitting idle and preparing contingencies and escape clauses.

    ESTP (Entrepreneur) personality
    Diving Right In
    ESTPs are a bold and brave bunch who are not afraid to take chances or act on their impulses. They live in the moment and dive into the action with an open mind and outward confidence. People with this personality type enjoy drama, passion, and pleasure, not for emotional thrills but because it’s so stimulating to their minds. They tend to make critical decisions based on factual, immediate reality in a process of rapid-fire rational stimulus responses.

    This makes school and other highly organized environments a challenge for ESTPs. It certainly isn’t because they aren’t smart, and they can do well there, but the regimented, lecturing approach of formal education is just so far from the hands-on learning that these personalities typically enjoy. It takes a great deal of maturity to see this process as a necessary means to an end – something that creates more exciting opportunities.

    Also challenging is that to ESTPs, it makes more sense to use their own moral compass than someone else’s. Rules were made to be broken. This is a sentiment that few school instructors or corporate supervisors are likely to share, and it can earn these personalities a certain reputation. But if they minimize the troublemaking, harness their energy, and focus through the boring stuff, ESTPs are a force to be reckoned with.

    The Path Less Traveled
    With perhaps the most perceptive, unfiltered view of any type, ESTPs have a unique skill in noticing small changes. Whether a shift in facial expression, a new clothing style, or a broken habit, people with this personality type pick up on hidden thoughts and motives where most types would be lucky to pick up anything specific at all. They use these observations immediately, calling out the change and asking questions even if it makes other people uncomfortable. ESTPs are as direct and straightforward as they come.

    Sometimes ESTPs’ instantaneous observation and action is just what’s required, as in some corporate environments, and especially in emergencies.
    People with the ESTP personality type are full of passion and energy, complemented by a rational, if sometimes distracted, mind. Inspiring, convincing, and colorful, they are natural group leaders, pulling everyone along the path less traveled, bringing life and excitement everywhere they go. Putting these qualities to a constructive and rewarding end is their true challenge.
    
    -ESTP Strengths
        ESTP (Entrepreneur) strengths
        Bold – People with the ESTP personality type (Entrepreneurs) are full of life and energy. There is no greater joy for them than pushing boundaries and discovering and applying new tools and ideas.
        Rational and Practical – These personalities love knowledge and philosophy, but not for their own sake. What’s fun for ESTPs is finding ideas that are actionable and drilling into the details so they can put them to use. If a discussion is completely arbitrary, there are better uses for their time.
        Original – Combining their boldness and practicality, ESTP personalities love to experiment with new ideas and solutions. They put things together in ways that no one else would think to.
        Perceptive – Their originality is helped by their ability to notice when things change – and when they need to change! Small shifts in habits and appearances stick out to ESTPs, and they use these observations to help create connections with others.
        Direct – ESTPs’ perceptiveness isn’t used for mind games – they prefer to communicate clearly, with direct and factual questions and answers. What you see is what you get with this personality type.
        Sociable – All these qualities pull together to make ESTP personalities natural group leaders. This isn’t something that they actively seek – they just have a knack for making excellent use of social interactions and networking opportunities.
    -ESTP Weaknesses
        ESTP (Entrepreneur) weaknesses
        Insensitive – Feelings and emotions come second to facts and pragmatism for people with the ESTP personality type. Emotionally charged situations are awkward, uncomfortable affairs, and blunt honesty doesn’t help here. They often have a lot of trouble acknowledging and expressing their own feelings as well, preferring not to dwell on heavy topics or the past for too long.
        Impatient – ESTPs move at their own pace to keep themselves entertained. Slowing down because someone else “doesn’t get it” or having to stay focused on a single detail for too long is extremely challenging for them.
        Impulsive – Impatience can lead ESTPs to push into uncharted territory without thinking of the long-term consequences. These personalities sometimes intentionally combat boredom with extra risk.
        Unstructured – ESTPs see an opportunity – to fix a problem, to advance, to have fun – and seize the moment, often ignoring rules and social expectations in the process. This can result in them getting things done, but it can also create unexpected social fallout if it rubs more traditional personality types the wrong way.
        May Miss the Bigger Picture – Living in the moment can cause ESTPs to miss the forest for the trees. People with this personality type love to solve problems here and now – perhaps too much. All parts of a project can be perfect, but the project will still fail if those parts do not fit together.
        Defiant – This type won’t be boxed in. Repetition, hardline rules, and sitting quietly while being lectured at are things that ESTP personalities don’t normally enjoy. They are action oriented and hands-on. Environments like school and much entry-level work can be so tedious that they’re intolerable, requiring extraordinary effort from ESTPs to stay focused long enough to get to freer positions.

-Entertainer
    ESFP Personality
    Entertainers are spontaneous, energetic, and enthusiastic people – life is never boring around them.
    Introduction
    Who is the Entertainer personality type?

    ESFP (Entertainer) is a personality type with the Extraverted, Observant, Feeling, and Prospecting traits. These people love vibrant experiences, engaging in life eagerly and taking pleasure in discovering the unknown. They can be very social, often encouraging others into shared activities.

    Live for each second without hesitation.

    ELTON JOHN
    If anyone is to be found spontaneously breaking into song and dance, it is people with the ESFP personality type (Entertainers). They get caught up in the excitement of the moment and want everyone else to feel that way too. No other type is as generous with their time and energy when it comes to encouraging others, and no other type does it with such irresistible style.

    ESFP (Entertainer) personality
    Living with Passion
    ESFP personalities are inclined toward putting on a show for others and generally appear to be very comfortable in the spotlight. However, it is not their love for being the center of attention that drives this sense of confidence but their knack for sensing what’s appropriate in certain situations. They have an uncanny ability to mirror the behaviors of those around them.

    ESFPs truly enjoy the simplest things, and there’s no greater joy for them than just having fun with a good group of friends. People with this personality type would almost always choose to be with friends over spending time alone. With their unique and earthy wit, they love soaking up attention and making every get-together feel a bit like a party.

    It’s not just talk either – ESFPs tend to have the strongest aesthetic sense of any personality type. From grooming and outfits to a well-appointed home, they have an eye for fashion. Knowing what’s attractive the moment they see it, they aren’t afraid to change their surroundings to reflect their personal style. This type is naturally curious, exploring new designs and styles with ease.

    Though it may not always seem like it, these personalities know that it’s not all about them – they are observant and very sensitive to others’ emotions. Often the first to help someone talk out a challenging problem, ESFPs happily provide emotional support and practical advice. However, if the problem is about them, they are more likely to avoid a conflict altogether than to address it head-on. This personality type usually loves a little drama and passion, but not so much when they are the focus of the criticisms it can bring.

    A Spontaneous Spirit
    The biggest challenge they face is that they are often so focused on immediate pleasures that they neglect the duties and responsibilities that make those luxuries possible. Complex analyses, repetitive tasks, and matching statistics to real consequences are not easy activities for people with the ESFP personality type. They’d rather rely on spontaneous opportunities or simply ask for help from their extensive circle of friends. It is important for ESFPs to challenge themselves to keep track of long-term things like their retirement plans or sugar intake – there won’t always be someone else around who can help to keep an eye on these things.

    ESFPs recognize value and quality, which on its own is a fine trait. In combination with their tendency to be poor planners, though, this can cause them to live beyond their means, and credit cards are especially dangerous. More focused on leaping at opportunities than in planning out long-term goals, they may find that their inattentiveness has made some activities unaffordable.

    There’s nothing that makes ESFPs feel quite as unhappy as realizing that they are boxed in by circumstance, unable to join their friends.
    ESFPs are welcome wherever there’s a need for laughter, playfulness, and a volunteer to try something new and fun – and there’s no greater joy for these personalities than to bring everyone else along for the ride. They can chat for hours, sometimes about anything but the topic they meant to talk about, and they share their loved ones’ emotions through good times and bad. If they can just remember to keep their ducks in a row, they’ll always be ready to dive into all the new and exciting things that the world has to offer, friends in tow.

    -ESFP Strengths
        ESFP (Entertainer) strengths
        Bold – People with the ESFP personality type (Entertainers) aren’t known for holding back. Wanting to experience everything there is to experience, they don’t mind stepping out of their comfort zones when no one else is willing.
        Original – Traditions and expectations are secondary to this personality type, if a consideration at all. ESFPs love to experiment with new styles and constantly find new ways to stand out in the crowd. Not stopping at mere outfits, they inject stylistic creativity into their words and actions too. Every day is a performance, and they love to put on a show.
        Positive and Enthusiastic – ESFPs are known for their zest for life and infectious enthusiasm. They naturally exude the kind of positivity that lights up a room and draws people to them, and this often translates into an engaging charisma that can inspire those around them. They tend to approach life and its multitude of experiences with an open mind, ready to immerse themselves in the new, the delightful, and the unexpected.
        Hands-on and Observant – To ESFPs, the world is meant to be felt and experienced. They prefer to see and do than to wax philosophical about “what-ifs.” With all this focus on the here and now, on doing and acting, it makes sense that ESFP personalities are naturals when it comes to noticing real, tangible things and changes.
        Excellent People Skills – More so than things, though, ESFPs love to pay attention to people. They are talkative, witty, and almost never run out of things to discuss. For these personalities, happiness and satisfaction stem from the time they spend with the people they enjoy being with.
    -ESFP Weaknesses
        ESFP (Entertainer) weaknesses
        Sensitive – ESFPs are strongly emotional and often vulnerable to criticism – they can feel like they’ve been backed into a corner, sometimes reacting badly. This is probably their greatest weakness, because it makes it so hard to address any other weaknesses brought to light.
        Conflict-Averse – ESFP personalities sometimes ignore and avoid conflict entirely. They tend to say and do what’s needed to get out of such situations, then move on to something more fun.
        Easily Bored – Without constant excitement, people with this personality type often find ways to create it themselves. Risky behavior, self-indulgence, and the pleasures of the moment over long-term plans are all things that ESFPs get into a little too often.
        Poor Long-Term Planners – ESFP personalities rarely make detailed plans for the future. To them, things come as they come, and too often they don’t bother with taking the time to lay out steps and consequences, believing that they could change at any moment.
        Unfocused – Anything that requires long-term dedication and focus is a particular challenge for people with the ESFP personality type. In academics, dense, unchanging subjects are much more difficult than more dynamic, relatable subjects. The trick for them is to find day-to-day joy in broader goals and to tough it out with those tedious things that must be done.
